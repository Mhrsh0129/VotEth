# VotEth — Decentralized Voting DApp (Sepolia)

VotEth is a simple, time-bound Ethereum voting dApp with a clean dark UI, MetaMask integration, and a Solidity smart contract deployed on Sepolia.

- Frontend: Vanilla HTML/CSS + Ethers.js (MetaMask)
- Smart contract: Solidity (Hardhat)
- Optional backend: Express.js helpers for admin tasks
- Network: Sepolia via Alchemy

Live site: https://app.voteth.xyz

**🚀 Auto-Deploy:** Every deployment automatically pushes to GitHub and updates the live site via Vercel!

> Branding: This project is branded as VotEth. Add your logo at `assets/branding/logo.png` if desired, and I can wire it into the UI.

## Features

- Vote for a candidate by index (0-based)
- Read-only candidate list on homepage (index + name)

- `scripts/manage-addresses.js` – Utility to manage contract addresses

## Pages

### 🗳️ Vote (index.html)
- Main voting interface
- Connect MetaMask
- Cast your vote
- View candidates
- Check voting status

### 📊 Results (ListVoters.html)
- View election results

- Quick switch between elections

## Useful Commands

### Deployment & Server
```powershell
npm start                    # Auto-deploy and start server
npm run deploy              # Deploy contract only
npm run server              # Start server only
```

### Contract Address Management
```powershell
npm run addresses           # List all contract addresses
npm run addresses:latest    # Show latest address
npm run addresses:list      # Show all deployments with details
npm run addresses:export    # Export to JSON
```

### Save Election Results to Log
Append current or final results to `contract-addresses.txt` for a given contract.

```powershell
# Save results for the latest deployed contract
npm run results:save

# Save results for a specific address
npm run results:save:addr -- 0xYourContractAddressHere
```

Notes:
- If voting is still active, a snapshot of current counts will be saved.
- Results are appended as a separate block with timestamp and winners.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- MetaMask installed in your browser
- Alchemy (or other) RPC URL for Sepolia
- A funded Sepolia account to deploy/execute admin txs

## Quick Start

### Automated Startup (Recommended)

Simply run one of these commands to automatically compile, deploy, and start the server:

```powershell
# Using the start script
npm start

# Or double-click start.bat
# Or run PowerShell script
.\start.ps1
```

This will automatically:
1. Install dependencies (if needed)
2. Compile smart contracts
3. Deploy to Sepolia network
4. Update contract addresses in all files
5. **Auto-commit and push to GitHub** 🆕
6. **Trigger Vercel auto-deployment** 🆕
7. Start the Express server

**New:** Changes are automatically pushed to GitHub, triggering Vercel to redeploy your live site at `app.voteth.xyz` with the new contract address!

See [COMPLETE_DOCUMENTATION.md](COMPLETE_DOCUMENTATION.md) for detailed guides.

### Manual Setup

1) Install dependencies

```powershell
npm install
```

2) Configure environment

- Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill values.
- Required variables:
  - `API_URL` – Sepolia RPC (e.g., Alchemy)
  - `PRIVATE_KEY` – Admin wallet private key (never commit)
  - `CONTRACT_ADDRESS` – Deployed Voting.sol address

3) Run the optional backend (for admin endpoints)

```powershell
node index.js
```

4) Open the frontend

- Open `index.html` in your browser (or serve statically)
- Click “Connect Metamask”, switch to Sepolia, and interact

Note: The frontend talks to the blockchain directly via MetaMask; the backend is optional and intended for admin helpers.

## Contract Deployment (Hardhat)

1) Configure Hardhat (network set to Sepolia) and `.env`
2) Deploy

```powershell
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network sepolia
```

3) Update `CONTRACT_ADDRESS` in `.env` and ensure `main.js` references it.

## Admin: Add Candidates (no UI)

Per your request, the frontend no longer exposes an add-candidate form. To add candidates:

- Use a Hardhat script/console to call `addCandidate(name)` outside the voting window, or
- Temporarily use the Express endpoint (`POST /addCandidate`) from `index.js` if desired.

Be sure to keep admin operations off the public UI.

## Branding

- Project Name: VotEth
- Logo: Add `assets/branding/logo.png` and reference it in README or HTML (optional)
- HTML Titles/Headers updated to VotEth

## Security Notes

- Do NOT commit your `.env` or private keys
- Verify the chain ID (Sepolia) in MetaMask before any transaction
- Contract only allows adding candidates before start or after end of voting

See **[COMPLETE_DOCUMENTATION.md](COMPLETE_DOCUMENTATION.md)**

## Quick Troubleshooting

- Ethers.js not defined: ensure the CDN `<script>` is loaded before `main.js`
- Wrong network: switch MetaMask to Sepolia
- Contract address wrong: update `CONTRACT_ADDRESS` in `.env` and ensure `main.js`'s address matches
