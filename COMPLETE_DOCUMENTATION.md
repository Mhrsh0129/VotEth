# 5. Previous Elections Access

## Detailed Feature Guide

### Feature Timeline

**Released:** October 31, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ Fully Implemented

### Components Added

1. **JavaScript Functions** (main.js)
   - `getSavedElections()` - Retrieve from localStorage
   - `saveElection()` - Save to localStorage
   - `switchContract()` - Switch to different contract
   - `updateElectionDisplay()` - Update UI
   - `loadElection()` - Load specific election

2. **UI Components**
   - Elections.html page
   - Current election display
   - Input field for addresses
   - History list display

3. **Storage System**
   - Browser localStorage
   - JSON format
   - Auto-management
   - 20 election limit

### Technical Implementation

#### Contract Address Validation

```javascript
// Validates Ethereum address format
if (!ethers.utils.isAddress(newAddress)) {
  alert("Invalid contract address!");
  return;
}
```

#### Data Persistence

```javascript
// Save to localStorage
localStorage.setItem('savedElections', JSON.stringify(elections));

// Load from localStorage
const saved = localStorage.getItem('savedElections');
return saved ? JSON.parse(saved) : [];
```

#### Auto-Limit Management

```javascript
// Keep only last 20 elections
if (elections.length > 20) elections.pop();
```

### Security Considerations

✅ **Address Validation**
- Checks Ethereum address format
- Validates before attempting connection

✅ **Read-Only Access**
- No write operations to old contracts
- View-only functionality

✅ **Network Verification**
- Only Sepolia network supported
- MetaMask required for all operations

✅ **Independent Contracts**
- Each election operates independently
- No cross-contamination

### Example Workflow

#### Accessing Last Month's Election

**Timeline:**

**September 30, 2025:**
```
Deploy Election A
Contract: 0xAAAA1111...
Name: "September Board Vote"
```

**October 31, 2025:**
```
Deploy Election B
Contract: 0xBBBB2222...
Name: "October Council Election"
(This becomes current)
```

**Later that day:**
```
Need to check September results:
1. Go to Elections page
2. Check history
3. Find "September Board Vote"
4. Click "Load"
5. ✅ Viewing September election!
```

**Switch back:**
```
1. Find "October Council Election" in history
2. Click "Load"
3. ✅ Back to current election
```

# 6. Contract Address Management

## Complete Guide

### System Overview

**Implemented:** October 31, 2025

Automatic logging system that tracks every deployment with complete details.

### Files Involved

1. **`contract-addresses.txt`** - Main log file
   - Human-readable format
   - Complete deployment details
   - Automatically updated

2. **`contract-addresses.json`** - JSON export (on demand)
   - Structured data
   - Machine-readable
   - For integrations

3. **`scripts/manage-addresses.js`** - Management utility
   - List addresses
   - Get latest
   - Export to JSON
   - Count deployments

### Automatic Logging

Every deployment via `npm start` or `npm run deploy`:

1. ✅ Contract deployed
2. ✅ Address logged to text file
3. ✅ .env updated
4. ✅ main.js updated
5. ✅ Ready to use

### Log Entry Details

Each entry includes:
- Deployment date (local time)
- ISO timestamp
- Contract address
- Network (Sepolia)
- Initial candidates list
- Voting duration
- Etherscan verification link

### Management Commands

#### List All Addresses

```bash
npm run addresses
```

Output shows numbered list of all addresses.

#### Get Latest Address

```bash
npm run addresses:latest
```

Shows most recently deployed address.

#### Full Details

```bash
npm run addresses:list
```

Shows complete log with all deployment information.

#### Export to JSON

```bash
npm run addresses:export
```

Creates `contract-addresses.json` with structured data.

### Use Cases

#### 1. Quick Reference

```bash
# Need contract address for sharing?
npm run addresses:latest

# Copy and share!
```

#### 2. Historical Audit

```bash
# Review all past deployments
npm run addresses:list

# See complete history with dates
```

#### 3. Team Collaboration

```bash
# Commit addresses file
git add contract-addresses.txt
git commit -m "Add new election deployment"
git push

# Team has access to all addresses
```

#### 4. Integration with Tools

```bash
# Export to JSON
npm run addresses:export

# Use in scripts
const deployments = require('./contract-addresses.json');
```

### Advanced Usage

#### PowerShell Analysis

```powershell
# Count deployments
(Select-String -Path contract-addresses.txt -Pattern "Contract Address:").Count

# Find specific address
Select-String -Path contract-addresses.txt -Pattern "0x8Cd9"

# View recent entries
Get-Content contract-addresses.txt -Tail 20
```

#### Programmatic Access

```javascript
const fs = require('fs');

function getAllAddresses() {
  const content = fs.readFileSync('contract-addresses.txt', 'utf8');
  const matches = content.matchAll(/Contract Address: (0x[a-fA-F0-9]{40})/g);
  return Array.from(matches, m => m[1]);
}

const addresses = getAllAddresses();
console.log(`Total deployments: ${addresses.length}`);
```

### Maintenance

#### File Size Management

- Each entry: ~300 bytes
- 100 deployments: ~30 KB
- 1000 deployments: ~300 KB
- Very manageable even with many deployments

#### Cleanup (Optional)

1. Open `contract-addresses.txt`
2. Keep header section
3. Remove old entries if needed
4. Save file

**Note:** File is append-only; grows over time but stays small.

### Backup Recommendations

1. **Git Repository**
   - File is tracked in git
   - Commit after important deployments
   - Team stays synchronized

2. **Regular Backups**
   - Export to JSON regularly
   - Copy to cloud storage
   - Include in project backups

3. **Archival**
   ```bash
   # Weekly archive
   cp contract-addresses.json archives/week-44-2025.json
   
   # Monthly archive
   cp contract-addresses.txt backups/2025-10.txt
   ```

# 9. Security & Best Practices

## Security Guidelines

### Environment Variables

❌ **Never do:**
- Commit `.env` file to git
- Share private keys
- Expose API keys publicly
- Use production keys in development

✅ **Always do:**
- Keep `.env` in `.gitignore`
- Use separate keys for testing
- Rotate keys regularly
- Use environment-specific configs

### Smart Contract Security

✅ **Implemented safeguards:**
- One vote per address
- Time-bound voting
- Admin-only candidate addition
- Immutable vote records

❌ **Avoid:**
- Deploying with mainnet keys
- Modifying contracts after deployment
- Bypassing access controls

### Frontend Security

✅ **Best practices:**
- Validate all user inputs
- Check network before transactions
- Verify contract addresses
- Use MetaMask for signing

❌ **Never:**
- Store private keys in frontend
- Trust client-side data only
- Skip address validation

### Network Security

✅ **Use Sepolia testnet for:**
- Development
- Testing
- Demonstrations
- Learning

❌ **Don't:**
- Deploy to mainnet without auditing
- Use testnet addresses on mainnet
- Mix testnet and mainnet

---

## Best Practices

   ```
   - Test all features
   - Verify on multiple browsers
   - Check different scenarios
   - Test with different wallets
   ```

### Election Management

1. **Naming Conventions**
   ```
   Good: "Q4 2025 Board Election"
   Good: "Student Council Fall 2024"
   Bad: "Election1"
   Bad: "test"
   ```

2. **Address Management**
   ```
