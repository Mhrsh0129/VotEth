# Project Branding

Replace placeholders across the project with your brand details.

Suggested updates:
- Brand name: e.g., "Your Brand Name"
- Logo: Add `assets/branding/logo.png` and reference it from README and/or HTML
- Colors: Primary `#132440` (background), Accent `#FFD700` (buttons), Hover `#D3DAD9`
- HTML: Update <title> tags and page headers to include your brand

If you provide a logo file, I can wire it into `index.html`.
